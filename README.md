# RockPaperScissor
Rock paper scissors is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "Scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. See who wins each round.
